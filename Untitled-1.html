        <h1>Important Notice Regarding Age Verification in Texas</h1>
        <p>Dear User,</p>
        <p>As you may know, the state of Texas is now requiring websites like ours to verify the age of visitors before allowing access.</p>
        
        <p>While we fully understand the state’s concern for protecting minors, we believe this approach is both overly restrictive and ineffective. Asking adults to provide identification each time they visit an adult website is not a practical solution for keeping minors safe online. In fact, it can actually harm your privacy and security.</p>
        
        <p class="important">The law forces platforms to choose between complying with unclear regulations or ignoring them, leaving many websites unprotected, with fewer safety measures in place. This means people could simply go to other sites that don’t have the same protections, which is exactly what we’re trying to avoid.</p>
        
        <p>As we’ve seen in other places, such laws don’t actually stop minors from accessing adult content. Instead, they drive users away from trusted websites like ours to those with fewer safeguards. We work hard to keep our site safe for users, and we believe any law aimed at protecting minors must be applied fairly across all adult websites.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the age verification law in Texas is not effective, and it could even harm content creators who rely on the ability to post and share their work. While we prioritize safety, we believe the best solution is for age verification to happen on the user’s device, so they can be properly identified without compromising their privacy.</p>
        
        <p class="important">Because of this law, we have made the difficult decision to block access to Pootango for users in Texas. This ensures we're in compliance with the regulations, but we also hope lawmakers will adopt solutions that actually make the internet safer and protect everyone's privacy.</p>
